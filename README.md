# YUI 0.3.0
## A UI system for GMS2 by [@shdwcat](https://github.com/shdwcat)

### Why YUI?
Writing UI code is annoying and tedious! Why write UI code when you can edit readable text files instead?

Notable features:
- [Live Reload](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/Live-Reload) while the game is running!
- Flexible and powerful [Data Binding](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/Data-Binding) and [scripting](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/YuiScript) system to get your game data into the UI
- [Template](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/Templates) system lets you design and re-use [custom widgets](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/Custom-Widgets)
- [Theme](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/Themes) system and widget styles
- Powerful [Drag and Drop](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/Drag-and-Drop) feature built in (no coding!)

Future features:
- Animation (slide/fade/etc)
- In Game Editor (?)

### OK, where do I start?
You can either clone the Example Project (this repo) to play around with it, or import the latest package from the Releases page.

Documentation is available on the Wiki (may be out of date at times)

### The Example Project
Contained in this repo is the YUI Example project. If you clone the repo locally you can run the project to get an idea of what YUI is capable of. The Example Project is still a work in progress, but make sure to check out the Inventory Screen for an example of how to quickly set up drag and drop!

### Dependencies
YUI has a number of dependencies, which are automatically included in the project.
