# YUI 0.5.0
## A UI system for GMS2 by [@shdwcat](https://github.com/shdwcat)

### Why YUI?
Writing UI code is annoying and tedious! Why write UI code when you can edit readable text files instead?

Notable features:
- [Live Reload](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/Live-Reload) while the game is running!
- Flexible and powerful [Data Binding](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/Data-Binding) and [Embedded Scripting](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/YuiScript) system to get your game data into the UI
- [Template](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/Templates) system lets you design and re-use [custom widgets](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/Custom-Widgets)
- UI Animation system - slide/fade/etc! Also supports color curves, animation sequences, and custom effects
- [Theme](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/Themes) system and widget styles
- Powerful [Drag and Drop](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki/Drag-and-Drop) feature built in (no coding!)
- VS Code syntax highlighting extension:

Future features:
- Improved keyboard/gamepad navigation
- In-game inspector/editor (?)

### OK, where do I start?
You can either clone the Example Project (this repo) to play around with it, or import the latest package from the [Releases](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/releases) page.

Please note that the [Wiki](https://github.com/shdwcat/YUI/wiki) is quite out of date (but may still be useful). 

### The Example Project
Contained in this repo is the YUI Example project. If you clone the repo locally you can run the project to get an idea of what YUI is capable of. The Example Project is still a work in progress, but make sure to check out the Inventory Screen for an example of how to quickly set up drag and drop!
