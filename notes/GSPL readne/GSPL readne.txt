# GSPL - Generic Scanner Parser Logic

This package contains many helpful scripts for implementing custom data formats or even
scripting languages inside GameMaker.

NOTE: There is no documentation for any of this yet, as I have been developing it primarily
	  for my own uses. If you find it useful, let me know and I can try to help ;)

Folders:

	Objects - GM game objects used by other parts of the system

	Scanner - Scripts to convert a string to a sequence of tokens to be parsed

	Parser - Scripts to convert an array of tokens into a syntax tree of some kind.
		For a data file, this may the struct representation of the data
		For a scripting language, this could be the expression tree representing the logic to be executed
	
	Execute - Scripts for executing an expression tree
	
	test - Stuff to help for testing during development
