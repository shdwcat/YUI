// |   Please edit this file!   |
// ==============================

// For Live Reload to work, YUI needs to know the FULL path to the 'datafiles' folder for your project.
// e.g. "D:/Projects/Game Design/YUI/datafiles/"
#macro YUI_USER_PROJECT_DATA_FOLDER undefined

// YUI also needs to know which folder in /datafiles/ contains the .yui files for the UI.
// In the Example Project, they're located in /datafiles/YUI/ but you can change that here.
#macro YUI_DATA_SUBFOLDER ""

// whether to enable compiling bindings to GML (requires Live Reload to be configured)
#macro YUI_ENABLE_COMPILER false



// actually do the init - DO NOT DELETE THIS!
__yui_init_live_reload();
